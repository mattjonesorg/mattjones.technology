I use techniques like Event Storming to get business and technology teams in the same room—mapping out processes, uncovering hidden complexities, and building a shared understanding before a single line of code is written. This collaborative approach eliminates confusion early, reduces rework, and sets projects on a path to success.

Beyond individual projects, I help organizations establish a clear technology strategy that stays aligned with business goals. Whether it’s modernizing legacy systems, adopting cloud services, or streamlining operations, my focus is always the same: making sure the technology serves the business—not the other way around.

Good architecture isn’t just about diagrams—it’s about building a foundation where teams can move faster, with less friction, and deliver real business value."""
