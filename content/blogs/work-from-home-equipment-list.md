<p>My employer, <a href="https://www.fitch.group/">Fitch Group</a>, recently announced an annual benefit to purchase home office supplies. Lot's of folks have asked me about my list, so here goes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is what I started with last year!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>WebCam: <a href="https://amzn.to/3CzCvXM">Logitech C922x Pro Stream Webcam</a> A well placed webcam makes a huge difference. Especially when you have these large monitors below, the laptop camera will never be at the best angle. With a good webcam, you can position it on top of the monitor. And the quality is way better than with the computer's built in cameras.</li>
<li>4K Monitor: <a href="https://amzn.to/3GQ2DQE">AOC U2790VQ 27" 4K 3840x2160 UHD Frameless Monitor, IPS, 5ms</a> I purchased a couple of large 4K monitors. I actually don't use my laptop's screen much anymore, and instead use these two big screens.</li>
<li>Monitor Arms: <a href="https://amzn.to/3WNJ0hH">Fully Jarvis Dual Monitor Mounting Arm - fits up to 32" Computer Displays (Dual, Black)</a> Monitor Arms are a great addition to any desk -- no longer do you have the monitor stands taking up space on your desk, instead, the monitors can be positioned right where you need them.</li>
<li>Docking Station: <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZmeTQ3">Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Mini W/ Thunderbolt 3 Cable (Thunderbolt Dock for MacOS and Windows USB-C Laptops, Dual 4K @60Hz, 40Gbps Transfer Speeds), Thunderbolt Mini</a> I needed one that could drive 2 4K monitors, and this one has worked great!</li>
<li>Keyboard: <a href="https://amzn.to/3vKWnTU">Logitech ERGO K860 Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard</a> A bluetooth keyboard has been great, as there are lots of wires for other accessories on my desk.</li>
<li>Mouse: <a href="https://amzn.to/3GqyYMy">Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse</a> For most of my life, I've been an "any mouse will work" kind of guy. This one changed that. I even bring it into the office when I have big presentations. One of it's killer features is app-specific behaviors on a couple of the buttons -- buttons on the mouse that mute/unmute voice and camera in Teams/Zoom!</li>
<li>Mouse Pad: <a href="https://amzn.to/3iv7oWi">Amazon Basics Gel Computer Mouse Pad with Wrist S... [truncated]</li>
</ul>

<p>And for this year, I'm looking at a few more things to help the home office set-up:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>USB Microphone: <a href="https://amzn.to/3io9SWu">Blue Yeti USB Microphone</a> I've loved my little USB speakrphone, but the speaker is starting to wear out, and I've noticed great audio from those who have this microphone.</li>
<li>Camera Lights: <a href="https://amzn.to/3IzvzgY">Logitech Litra Glow Premium LED Streaming Light with TrueSoft</a> My basement has harsh lighting, this should help a lot.</li>
<li>Laptop Chiller: <a href="https://amzn.to/3GoBMd7">Targus 17 inch Dual Fan Lap Chill Mat - Soft Neoprene Laptop Cooling Pad, Heat Protection Laptop Cooler, Dual-fan Heat Dispersion</a> My laptop gets warm frequently, this looks like a good solution to cool it down a bit.</li>
<li>Uninteruptible Power Supply: <a href="https://amzn.to/3GvBq4i">Amazon Basics Line-Interactive UPS 1000VA 550 Watt Surge Protector Battery Power Backup, 9 Outlets - Black</a> There have been a few power outages in the last year, that always occur at the most inopportune times. And since the computer is a laptop, it carries on just fine, but I always lose the network connection. This UPS will power my home networking gear to keep it up and running in the event of a power outage.</li>
<li>Portable Monitor: <a href="https://amzn.to/3GS5OHI">ViewSonic 15.6 Inch 1080p Portable Monitor with IPS Touchscreen, 2 Way Powered 60W USB C, Eye Care, Dual Speakers, Built in Stand with Cover</a> Sometimes, instead of working at my desk, I'm taking advantage of a benefit that allows me to work from another state. Or, I'm facilitating a hybrid meeting in the office, and a second monitor in the meeting room would be helpful to have speaker notes. This will help in all those situations.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all these USB connections, I needed a new base station:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3QXhFaH">Plugable 14-in-1 USB-C and Thunderbolt Dock - 40Gbps with 96W Charging, Compatible with Mac and Windows, 2X HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort, 7X USB Ports, Ethernet, Audio, SD/MicroSD</a></li>
