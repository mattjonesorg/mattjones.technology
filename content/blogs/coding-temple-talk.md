I had a chance to give a talk for [Coding Temple](http://www.codingtemple.com/) last night touching on why learning Javascript is a good idea. I also touched a bit on AngularJS and gave a perspective of a hiring manager to the participants of the coding bootcamp.

Here are the slides:

I'd be happy to present as a hiring manager to just about any group in the Chicago Area. Let me know if you are interested.
