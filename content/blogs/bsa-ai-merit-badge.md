I'm grateful for the Scout leaders who shaped my pathâ€”especially the one who sparked my passion for technology through the Computers merit badge (now retired).

Today, I volunteer as a leader with Scouting America, passing forward what I learned. While I love teaching fire building, outdoor cooking, and leadership skills, I'm especially excited to sign up to be a merit badge counselor for the new Artificial Intelligence badge.

It's incredible to see Scouting evolve to prepare young people for tomorrow's challenges. I'm looking forward to helping the next generation explore AI and its possibilities.
Full circle moments like these remind me why mentorship matters.
