24 years ago tonight, a few friends and I got together and started work on the first website I ever made, Prayers For Peace. It was in memory of the victims of 9/11. In these 24 years, I've reviewed thousands of memories and prayers. 

The original site was written in technology that was perfect for it's time -- Perl with a MySQL database. This summer, I rewrote it using NodeJS, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and Cognito, with a little help from Claude Code. 

Please take a moment today to post your memory or prayer. I'll make sure they get reviewed tonight!
