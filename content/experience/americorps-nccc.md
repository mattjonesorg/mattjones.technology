    Almost 20 years ago, I took this pledge before commencing on 1750 hours of community service. I still Get Things Done.
    <blockquote>I will get things done for America - to make our people safer, smarter, and healthier. I will bring Americans together to strengthen our communities. Faced with apathy, I will take action. Faced with conflict, I will seek common ground. Faced with adversity, I will persevere. I will carry this commitment with me this year and beyond.I am an AmeriCorps member, and I will get things done.</blockquote>
